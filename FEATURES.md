# CSV HTML Editor - Features Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you understand how to use the CSV HTML Editor to update HTML content in your CSV files.

## What is this tool?

The CSV HTML Editor is a web-based tool that helps you edit HTML content inside CSV files. Instead of manually editing CSV files in a spreadsheet, you can visually edit HTML and see your changes in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Upload Your CSV File

- **Drag and drop** your CSV file onto the upload area, or click to browse
- The tool will automatically detect your file and load it

### Step 2: Select Columns with HTML Content

- After uploading, you'll see a list of all columns in your CSV
- **Select the columns** that contain HTML content (you can select multiple)
- Click "Continue" to proceed

### Step 3: Start Editing

Once your file is loaded, you'll see three panels:

- **Left Panel**: List of all records (rows) in your CSV
- **Center Panel**: Editor where you can edit the HTML content
- **Right Panel**: List of all links found in the current record

## Key Features

### 🔍 Search Records

- Use the **search box** at the top of the records list to quickly find specific records
- Search works across all columns - just type what you're looking for
- See how many records match your search

### 📝 Edit HTML Content

- Click on any record in the left panel to start editing
- The center panel shows a **visual editor** where you can:
  - Edit text content
  - Update link URLs
  - Format text (bold, italic, etc.)
  - See a preview of how your HTML will look

### 🔗 Edit Links

- All links in the current record appear in the **right panel**
- Click on any link to open the **Link Editor**
- Update the URL, and click "Save" to apply changes
- Changes are saved automatically

### 🧭 Navigate Between Records

**Using Mouse:**

- Click on any record in the left panel to jump to it

**Using Keyboard:**

- **Arrow Keys** (← → ↑ ↓): Navigate between records one at a time
- Works great for quickly moving through your data!

**Using Navigation Buttons:**

- Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons in the header to jump between records that contain links
- This helps you focus only on records that need link updates

### 💾 Save Your Work

- **Changes are saved automatically** as you edit
- A "Saving..." indicator appears when changes are being saved
- The header shows how many records have been modified

### 📥 Download Your Updated CSV

- Click the **Download** button in the header when you're done editing
- Your updated CSV file will download with all your changes
- The download button shows how many records have been modified

### 🎨 Visual Feedback

- **Modified records** are tracked - you can see how many changes you've made
- The **selected record** is highlighted in the list
- **Links** are clearly listed and easy to identify

## Tips for Content Editors

1. **Start with Search**: Use the search feature to quickly find the records you need to update

2. **Use Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys make it fast to move through records - much faster than clicking!

3. **Check the Links Panel**: Always check the right panel to see all links in a record before editing

4. **Save Frequently**: While changes auto-save, it's good practice to download your work periodically
